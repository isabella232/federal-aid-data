# Federal Aid Data Outline

### Percent of borrowers by borrow amount 
**Note**: Amount borrowers have left on loan, not original loan amount. Pull out that most defaulters are under 40k and a lot of defaulters are 5-10k.
*Numbers from q3 2017 fiscal year

### By school type
#### Public/private/proprietary
Nine out of 10 of the schools with the highest default rates are proprietary, for-profit schools. Though, on average, public schools have the highest default rates.

From the 10 public schools with the lowest numbers, seven are health-science schools. On the flip side, from the 10 public school with the highest default rates, **nine out of 10** schools are community colleges.

Not sure if there's an interesting visualization in this, but I can keep looking at the numbers and get more expansive data if it's interesting.

#### Ethnicity
Native American schools, most likely because there are only four of them, have the highest default rates. HBCUs follow, then Hispanic and PWIs

### By Location
If the location data makes sense to use, here are two different takes:

*Note: After talking it through with Aly, she doesn't think it makes much since to cross reference the location data with something like educational attainment. So, if it makes sense to use the data as is, we can. If not, we can drop it.
